#Overview of Artificial Intelligence

AI – Branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems/machines that simulate human intelligence and perform tasks.
– Simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn and make decisions.
– Tasks – Thinking, learning, problem solving, perception, language understanding.

#Types of AI: Based on Capability and Functionality

1) Capability:

#Narrow AI (Weak AI)

Designed for specific task.

Most current AI systems fall into this category.

Example: Voice Assistant (Siri, Alexa), Recommender systems


#General AI (Strong AI)

Aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

Can generalize the learning from one domain to another.

Still theoretical, no real-world system achieved yet.


#Super AI

Hypothetical future AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.

Performs tasks better than humans.

Raises concerns about ethics, safety, and control.


AGI

ASI

#Based on Functionality:

1. Reactive Machines

No memory, purely reactive to immediate situations

Ex: IBM's Deep Blue (chess-playing machine)



2. Limited Memory

Can learn from historic data and make decisions

Most modern AI systems fall under this

Example: Self-driving cars



3. Theory of Mind (Research stage)

Understand emotions, beliefs, and thoughts of other beings (hypothetical AI)



4. Self Aware AI (Still theory)

Has own consciousness and self-awareness

#Evaluation (RB → ML → DL → Gen AI)

1) Rule Based System:

Based on predefined logic and ‘if-then’ rules written by humans.

No learning from data.


Evaluation:

Correctness: Does system behave as expected

Coverage: Can it handle all scenarios

Maintainability: Is it easy to update



---

2) Machine Learning:

Learn from data (patterns)

Algorithms include: Classifiers, SVM, Linear Regression, Decision Trees


Evaluation:

Regression: MAE, R², MSE

Classification: Recall, Precision, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, ROC-AUC Curve



---

3) Deep Learning:

Subset of ML using multi-layer neural networks

Handle large, unstructured data


Evaluation: Same as ML with added metrics for specific tasks

For image tasks:

Top-k accuracy

IoU (for object detection)


For sequence models:

BLEU Score (in NLP)

Perplexity



Examples: Face recognition, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles


---

4) Generative AI (Gen AI)

Uses deep learning to generate new content (text, video, image)

Based on LLMs (like GPT), VAEs


Evaluation Metrics:

For Text Generation:

BLEU, ROUGE (text similarity under truth)

Perplexity

Human evaluation


For Image Generation:

Inspection Score

Frechet Inception Distance


For Code Generation:

Pass ratio (test cases)

Exact match with expected output



Examples: ChatGPT, GANs

Stages Comparison Table:

Stage	Logic Source	Data Dependency	Human Effort	Evaluation Type

RB	Rule-based	Handcoded rules	High	Manual testing
ML	Data patterns	Labeled data	Medium	Accuracy, Precision, F1, ROC-AUC
DL	Neural networks	Large data + GPU	Low	Complex metrics (IoU, BLEU, etc.)
Gen AI	LLMs	Massive unstructured data	Minimal	Quality + Creativity



---

For Classification Tasks

Accuracy: Ratio of correct predictions to total predictions (Best when classes are balanced)

Precision: TP / (TP + FP) → How many predicted positives were correct

Recall: TP / (TP + FN) → How many actual positives detected

F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

ROC-AUC: Area under ROC curve (TPR vs FPR)

Confusion Matrix: Table showing TP, FP, FN, TN



---

For Regression Tasks

MAE, MSE, R² Score, RMSE



---

Unsupervised Models

Used when there are no labels and we want to group similar data points
Metrics:

Silhouette Score

Davies-Bouldin Index

Inertia

Dunn Index
